# Lantern projects

Here you will find a list of different projects I made for Lantern Institute :

### Glass Type Classification



The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence...if it is correctly identified!
For this project we used Python programming language and the KNN classifier. The data was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Sleep Data



The project consists in analyzing the quality and the duration of sleep of an individual according to data coming from different devices  considering the different timezones. For this project we used Python programming language, regression and time series. You can find the data file in this link:
